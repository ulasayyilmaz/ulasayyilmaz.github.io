    I am the Vice-President of the Claremont Colleges Turkish Student Association. We are 14 Turks at the Claremont Colleges(9 in Pomona), and I help the president organize cultural events. I have presented the 2021 budget, and awarded $1400 for the club. Most recently, after the 7.8 Magnitude Turkish-Syrian Earthquake, I spearheaded a donation campaign which fundraised more than $16,000. We raised awareness by tabling outside the dining halls for an entire week, by pitching to professors and Deans of the college, and by interviewing to The Student Life Newspaper, and by interviewing to Pomona College Communications.
