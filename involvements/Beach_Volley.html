    I also serve as the Captain of the Claremont Colleges Beach Volleyball Club Team. I manage a group of 20+ students by conducting twice weekly practices on Pomona's sand volleyball courts or indoor volleyball gym. I lead warm-up exercises, volleyball drills, and scrimmages. I report to the Athletics department, and have presented, and awarded a budget of $400 for the club.
